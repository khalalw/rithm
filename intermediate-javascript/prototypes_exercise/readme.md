## Prototypes Exercise 

### Part I:

Make the tests pass for the following tasks:

- Create a constructor function for a Person. Each person should have a firstName, lastName, favoriteColor, favoriteNumber and favoriteFoods (which should be an array).

- Add a function on the Person.prototype called `fullName` that returns the firstName and lastName property of an object created by the Person constructor concatenated together.

```javascript
var p = new Person("Shana", "Malarkin", "Green", 38);
p.fullName(); // Shana Malarkin
```

- Overwrite the `toString` method from the Object prototype by creating a `toString` method for `Person`.  The `toString` method should return a string in the following format:


```javascript
var p = new Person("Shana", "Malarkin", "Green", 38);
p.toString(); // Shana Malarkin, Favorite Color: Green, Favorite Number: 38
```

- Add a property on the Person object called `family` which is an empty array.

- Add a function on the Person.prototype called `addToFamily` which adds an object constructed from the Person constructor to the `family` array. To make sure that the object you are adding is an object construced from the Person constructor - take a look at the `instanceof`operator. Make sure that your `family` array does not include duplicates! This method should return the length of the `family` array.

```javascript
var p = new Person("Shana", "Malarkin", "Green", 38) 
p.family; // []
p.addToFamily(p); // 1
p.family.length; // 1
p.addToFamily(p); // 1 - No duplicates!
p.family.length; // Length should still be 1
```

### Part II:

Make the tests pass for the following tasks:

- Implement your own version of `Array.prototype.map`

- Implement a function that reverses a string and place it on the `String.prototype`

- Implement your own version of `Function.prototype.bind`

### Part III:

For the last part, let's think less about the actual code we need to write and more about thinking in an Object Oriented way. 

- Let's imagine that we are building an application which allows users to play chess. What constructor functions would we need? What kinds of prototype functions and properties would we need as well?

- Let's imagine that we are building a game of Tic Tac Toe. What kinds of prototype functions and properties would we need as well?

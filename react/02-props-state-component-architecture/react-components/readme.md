## React Components Exercise

Create two components, TodoList and Todo. The TodoList component should contain an array called todos. The TodoList component should be responsible for listing all of the Todo components, which should each display the task necessary to complete.

You have full control of what you would like the UI of this application to be, but think carefully about the components you will need as well as the props and state. To get started faster, use create-react-app so that you don't have to worry about configuring webpack and babel.

This repository contains the exercises for Rithm School's free [React Fundamentals](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/react-fundamentals) course.  React is a more advanced topic, so if you are new to JavaScript, we would suggest starting with our free JavaScript courses which are also available on [Rithm School](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses).

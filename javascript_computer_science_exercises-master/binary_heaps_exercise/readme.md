# Binary Heaps Exercise

For this exercise you must get the tests to pass.

### Part I

Given the following constructor function

```js
function MaxBinaryHeap(val){
    this.values = [];
}
```

#### insert

Implement the `insert` function on the `MaxBinaryHeap.prototype`: This function should insert a node in a binary heap. Make sure to re-order the heap after insertion if necessary

### Part II

Implement a function called checkMaxHeap. It should check if an array is a valid Max Heap and return true or false.

Given an array of numbers, implement a function called `maxHeapify` which converts an array of numbers into a max-heap. Note that this function assumes a correct implentation of checkMaxHeap.

### Bonus

Implement the `remove` function on the `MaxBinaryHeap.prototype` This function should remove the root node in a binary heap. Make sure to re-order the heap after removal if necessary
